[M100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_100), sometimes called "The Blowdryer Galaxy", is a grand design spiral galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. It is 55 million lighyears distant and 107,000 lighyears in diameter.


Another result from Antenna Site in the desert west of Phoenix. Skies were great and I got some excellent luminance data. Color was captured at my house in Chandler. I have been lucky with a lot of clear skies so I captured an absolute ton of RGB data -- most of which was good to use, but I did lose some reds to thin clouds.
