[M106](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_106) is a very active galaxy 22 to 25 million lightyears distant and 135,000 lighyears in diameter. It's central supermassive black hole energizes the gas in the core producing a lot of light.


Another result from Antenna Site in the desert west of Phoenix. Skies were great and I got some excellent luminance data. Color was captured at my house in Chandler. I have been lucky with a lot of clear skies so I captured an absolute ton of RGB data -- most of which was good to use, but I did lose some reds to thin clouds.
