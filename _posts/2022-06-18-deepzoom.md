You've completed your mosaic and you want to share it with others at full resolution but the file is enormous.
In this guide I will show you how to create a .dzi file (deep zoom image) from a high resolution image and how
to use it on your website using [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/).

# Installing libvips

Libvips is an open source image processing library that you will use to create a DZI from a TIF.

## Windows

Download the [latest binaries](https://github.com/libvips/build-win64-mxe/releases).
At the time of writing `vips-dev-w64-web-8.12.2-static.zip` is the latest.
Extract the zip to your C: drive and rename to `vips`.

Next you need to tell Windows where `vips.exe` is by adding it to `PATH`.
Press the Windows key and type `environment` and select `Edit the system environment variables.`

![Edit the system environment variables](/assets/img/astrophotography/2022-06-18-deepzoom/start-menu-environment.png){: w="759" h="366" .nolink }
_Edit the system environment variables._

Select the `Environment Variables...` button at the bottom of the window.

At the bottom under `System variables`, find `PATH`, select it, and press the `Edit` button.

Select the `New` button and a blank entry will be added to the bottom of hte list. Enter `C:\vips\bin`.
This adds this directory to the `PATH` system variable. Now when you type `vips` in the command line, Windows will search
`C:\vips\bin` for an executable named `vips.exe`.

![Add vips directory to path](/assets/img/astrophotography/2022-06-18-deepzoom/add-vips-to-path.png){: w="527" h="501" .nolink }
_Add vips directory to PATH_

Open a command line and type `vips` and you should see the built-in help.

![Vips is found and runs](/assets/img/astrophotography/2022-06-18-deepzoom/command-line-windows-vips.png){: w="1115" h="628" .nolink }
_Vips is found and runs_

## Linux (Ubuntu)

Libvips is available through apt.

```shell
sudo apt install libvips-tools
```

# Creating the DZI

In PixInsight export your completed mosaic as an 8-bit TIF. 16-bit will work but the images that make up the DZI are 8-bit JPG so the extra file size will take longer to convert.

![Export as 8-bit TIF](/assets/img/astrophotography/2022-06-18-deepzoom/export-8bit-tif.png){: w="499" h="754" .nolink }
_Export as 8-bit TIF_

Open a command line and navigate to where you exported your image and convert the TIF to a DZI.

```shell
vips dzsave "Heart and Soul Mosaic Watermarked For Web.tiff" heart_soul
```

By default the tiles are JPG with 75% quality. You can increase the quality (and size) of the tiles with the following command:

```shell
vips dzsave "Heart and Soul Mosaic Watermarked For Web.tiff" heart_soul --suffix .jpg[Q=90]
```

You should now have a file named `heart_soul.dzi` and a directory named `heart_soul_files`.
These two items together are the mosaic. The dzi is metadata about the image and the directory contains the image tiles.

# Using OpenSeadragon

[OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) can view many kinds of large images and the viewer can be heavily customized.
I will show a simple example on how to view your dzi locally.

Create a new directory and move `heart_soul.dzi` and `heart_soul_files` into the new directory.

Download the latest openseadragon and extract it into the new directory. Rename the `openseadragon-bin-x.x.x` directory to simply `openseadragon`.

Create `viewer.html` with the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            #openseadragon1 {
                width: 800px;
                height: 600px;
            }
        </style>
        <script src="openseadragon/openseadragon.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="openseadragon1"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            OpenSeadragon({
                    id: "openseadragon1",
                    prefixUrl: "openseadragon/images/",
                    tileSources: "heart_soul.dzi"
                });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Due to security implications, modern browsers will no longer load local files. You can read more about this [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp). In order to get around this you must run a local webserver. The simplest way to do this is to install python and run `python -m http.server` from the directory that contains `viewer.html`. Then you can browse to `http://localhost:8000/viewer.html` and see your image!

{% openseadragon {"image":"https://alexhelms.s3.amazonaws.com/public/assets/img/astrophotography/mosaic/heart_soul_2021/heart_soul.dzi"} %}

I have done additional customization to the viewer for alexhelms.com, but your viewer will be similar.
Check out the openseadragon documentation to see what kind of customizations you can do.
