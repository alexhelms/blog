This image started as a meme where the focus would be on M110 and you'd just ignore Andromeda over there in the corner.
But after I started getting some data I was surprised at how much detail I was getting on M110, including two dust lanes!
My scope is right on the edge of resolving more stars in M110 so the fine details look funky. Noise reduction
really did not like this data set whatsoever so I had to modify my normal processing workflow.
