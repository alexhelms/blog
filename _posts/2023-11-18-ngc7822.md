NGC 7822, sometimes called the Question Mark Nebula, is a huge nebula so my field of view can only get a portion of it without resorting to a a mosaic.
This image was the first time trying 10 minute exposures for narrowband. The results turned out great so I will continue using 10 minute exposures moving forward.
I used to be hesitant about 10 minute exposures simply because it requires a lot more of a commitment, but now being fully remote, I have time to get a sufficient
number of frames to get a good SNR.
