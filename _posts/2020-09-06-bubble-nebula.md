The [Bubble Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_7635) is a HA emission nebula in Cassiopeia with a distinct bubble shape.

With monsoon season coming to a close the skies are finally clear again. Monsoon season this year was disappointing -- it was just hot and cloudy. It was so hot that we broke all the records. With the skies clearing up and temperatures coming down, I'm looking forward to imaging again! :sad:
