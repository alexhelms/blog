Bode's Galaxy, also known as [M81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_81), is a spiral galaxy 12 million light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major. 


Some astrophotographer friends and I went to a site known as "Antenna Site" out in the desert 90 miles west of Phoenix.
This location is very dark with excellent skies. Skies to the east are a bit polluted from Phoenix but the remainder of
the sky is very dark and near bortle 1 conditions. There were thin high clouds that came through a couple times but 
generally was pretty clear with excellent seeing.

I focused on collecting luminance data at Antenna Site because of its darkness. A trip the following weekend to Picketpost
Mountain net me the the RGB data needed to finish the image.

If you look closely at the image below, you can see [Holmberg IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmberg_IX), a dwarf irregular satellite galaxy of M81. It has an
apparent magnitude of 16.5 and the fact it is in the image is a testament to how dark Antenna Site really is!
