The [Antennae Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antennae_Galaxies) are a pair of interacting galaxies with beautiful long tails. The effects of the two galaxies merging have triggered intense star formation which is visible as the pink regions in the galaxies.


Back to Antenna Site to capture some Antennae Galaxies! I got as much luminance as I could from the dark site and capture the RGB at home. Antennae is pretty low in the sky here in Phoenix -- it barely gets above 40 degrees -- making getting enough images on of this target fairly difficult. There are only a few hours of the night where it is viable to image, and even then, the FWHM is less than ideal.
