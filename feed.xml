In this guide I will show you how to create a .dzi file (deep zoom image) from a high resolution image and how to use it on your website using OpenSeadragon. Installing libvips Libvips is an open source image processing library that you will use to create a DZI from a TIF.

This 16 panel (4x4) mosaic of the Heart and Soul nebula was taken in November 2021.

This emission nebula is one of my favorites. My focal length precludes me from imaging the entire heart nebula so I just got my favorite part instead. A mosaic of the heart nebula at 2000mm focal length would be quite the project! I processed this image after the Helix Nebula. I took the pixel math learnings and applied it to this image. ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Helix Nebula</title><link href="https://alexhelms.com/posts/helix-nebula/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Helix Nebula" /><published>2020-09-26T18:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2022-06-15T21:16:00-07:00</updated> <id>https://alexhelms.com/posts/helix-nebula/</id> <content src="https://alexhelms.com/posts/helix-nebula/" /> <author> <name>Alex Helms</name> </author> <category term="Astrophotography" /> <summary> The Helix Nebula is my favorite planetary nebula. It is also the closest of the bright planetary nebulas at 655 light years. I have been trying to image the Helix Nebula for 4 years. Each year presented a new problem which prevent me from completing the project. At my latitude, the nebula only gets to 36 degrees elevation. It is just so low in the sky that guiding is not reliable because of sc... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Bubble Nebula</title><link href="https://alexhelms.com/posts/bubble-nebula/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bubble Nebula" /><published>2020-09-06T18:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2022-06-15T21:16:00-07:00</updated> <id>https://alexhelms.com/posts/bubble-nebula/</id> <content src="https://alexhelms.com/posts/bubble-nebula/" /> <author> <name>Alex Helms</name> </author> <category term="Astrophotography" /> <summary> The Bubble Nebula is a HA emission nebula in Cassiopeia with a distinct bubble shape. With monsoon season coming to a close the skies are finally clear again. Monsoon season this year was disappointing – it was just hot and cloudy. It was so hot that we broke all the records. With the skies clearing up and temperatures coming down, I’m looking forward to imaging again! :sad: Gear ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
