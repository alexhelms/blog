Hi, I'm Alex Helms. I'm a software engineer at Renesas during the day and an astrophotographer at night. 
I have been writing software since I was a kid, and professionally since 2014. In the past I developed
micron-scale machine vision systems for wafer sort and test. Now I continue development of a green-field 
project for configuring timing devices at Renesas. [Follow me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-helms-13b77479/) on LinkedIn.

When the sun is down my telescope out capturing the beauty of the skies. I post completed projects from single images,
to mosaics, to guides and how-tos. Check out the [Astrophotography](/categories/astrophotography/) category to see my photos.
