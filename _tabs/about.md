Hi, I'm Alex Helms.

I'm a software engineer and an astrophotographer.
I grew up in Maryland, where the night skies are filled with ligh pollution.
In 2010, I moved to Phoenix, Arizona.
Just a month after moving, I went to the desert to experience the dark skies and was instantly hooked.
Soon after, I bought my first telescope and my passion for astrophotography began -- and it hasn't stopped since.

I've been writing software since I was a little kid and professionally since 2014.
My work has spanned semiconductor R&D tools, validation software for ASICs, and medical CRM systems.
Outside of work, Iâ€™m constantly immersed in astronomy-related software projects, including data organization tools, all-sky camera systems, and observatory control systems.

I'm a partner at [Sonoran Desert Skies Observatory (SDSO)](https://sdso.space), where my telescope is housed alongside three others.
While I primarily focus on capturing stunning astrophotography, I've recently embarked on a scientific journey.
I collect photometry data for asteroids and exoplanets, and also work on confirming near-Earth asteroids (NEOs).
