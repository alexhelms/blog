Enter C:\\vips\\bin.This adds this directory to the PATH system variable. Now when you type vips in the command line, Windows will searchC:\\vips\\bin for an executable named vips.exe.Add vips directory to PATHOpen a command line and type vips and you should see the built-in help.Vips is found and runsLinux (Ubuntu)Libvips is available through apt.sudo apt install libvips-toolsCreating the DZIIn PixInsight export your completed mosaic as an 8-bit TIF. 16-bit will work but the images that make up the DZI are 8-bit JPG so the extra file size will take longer to convert.Export as 8-bit TIFOpen a command line and navigate to where you exported your image and convert the TIF to a DZI.vips dzsave \"Heart and Soul Mosaic Watermarked For Web.tiff\" heart_soulBy default the tiles are JPG with 75% quality. You can increase the quality (and size) of the tiles with the following command:vips dzsave \"Heart and Soul Mosaic Watermarked For Web.tiff\" heart_soul --suffix .jpg[Q=90]You should now have a file named heart_soul.dzi and a directory named heart_soul_files.These two items together are the mosaic. The dzi is metadata about the image and the directory contains the image tiles.Using OpenSeadragonOpenSeadragon can view many kinds of large images and the viewer can be heavily customized.I will show a simple example on how to view your dzi locally.Create a new directory and move heart_soul.dzi and heart_soul_files into the new directory.Download the latest openseadragon and extract it into the new directory. Rename the openseadragon-bin-x.x.x directory to simply openseadragon.Create viewer.html with the following:&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; #openseadragon1 { width: 800px; height: 600px; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;script src=\"openseadragon/openseadragon.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=\"openseadragon1\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt; OpenSeadragon({ id: \"openseadragon1\", prefixUrl: \"openseadragon/images/\", tileSources: \"heart_soul.dzi\" }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;Due to security implications, modern browsers will no longer load local files. You can read more about this here. In order to get around this you must run a local webserver. The simplest way to do this is to install python and run python -m http.server from the directory that contains viewer.html. Then you can browse to http://localhost:8000/viewer.html and see your image! I have done additional customization to the viewer for alexhelms.com, but your viewer will be similar.Check out the openseadragon documentation to see what kind of customizations you can do." }, { "title": "Heart and Soul", "url": "/posts/heart-soul-mosaic/", "categories": "Astrophotography", "tags": "Narrowband, Nebula, IC, Mono, Mosaic", "date": "2022-06-15 22:00:00 -0700", "snippet": " A fresh look for the site and a day spent integrating OpenSeadragon, I now have a way to present mosaics!

A mosaic of the heart nebula at 2000mm focal length would be quite the project!I processed this image after the Helix Nebula. I took the pixel math learnings and applied it to this image. Additional tweaks seemed to help bring out the OIII more but required more color balancing. One thing I noticed is this method has significantly lower background noise than the traditional bi-color combination pixel math. This makes sense because we are multiplying the values together, so high SNR will be preferentially selected in the combined image.R: haG: oiii*ha*1.25B: (oiii * (oiii-ha)) + 1.1*oiiiThe skies are finally clear after all the fires and monsoons seem to be done.

It is also the closest of the bright planetary nebulas at 655 light years.I have been trying to image the Helix Nebula for 4 years. Each year presented a new problem which prevent me from completing the project. At my latitude, the nebula only gets to 36 degrees elevation. It is just so low in the sky that guiding is not reliable because of scintillation. My old Celestron CGEM was not able to track reliably, nor was the AP Mach 1. Now that I have a 10Micron GM1000, most of my imaging is unguided. It had no problems tracking Helix through the low elevation. The gear problems and monsoon season coming to a close have prevent me for years!
